# Lab Assignment 4
In this lab assignment, you will need to complete the Adversarial Attacks Against Machine Learning Based SpamFilters Lab module using Google Colab. The learning objective of this lab is for students to gain the first-hand experience on the machine learning based spam filters and corresponding adversarial attacks. Coding experience is recommended, so you might want to work with someone with programming backgrounds. 

## Environment Setup

For this lab, you will need to use google colab, and you need a google account to use it. If you have never used google colab or jupyter notebook before, you can go through this tutorial first: https://colab.research.google.com/github/cs231n/cs231n.github.io/blob/master/python-colab.ipynb.
