# Lab Assignment 4
In this lab assignment, you will need to complete the Adversarial Attacks Against Machine Learning Based SpamFilters Lab module using Google Colab. The learning objective of this lab is for students to gain the first-hand experience on the machine learning based spam filters and corresponding adversarial attacks. Coding experience is recommended, so you might want to work with someone with programming backgrounds. 

## Environment Setup

For this lab, you will need to use google colab, and you need a google account to use it. If you have never used google colab or jupyter notebook before, you can go through this tutorial first: https://colab.research.google.com/github/cs231n/cs231n.github.io/blob/master/python-colab.ipynb.

### Google Colab
For this lab, you will need to use google colab. First, open the link below:
https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/
Click upload and then choose the notebook file you downloaded from the blackboard.
Then you will be able to work on the lab manual. 

## Adversarial Attacks Against Machine Learning Based Spam Filters (50 points)
The lab manual is release in Canvas. The dataset needed for the first step of loading dataset, is in this Git folder called messages.csv. Please download it.
Please write all your answers and code in the lab manual you downloaded. You will find a textbox or code block for each question or task. You don't need to write a seperate report for this lab, but please explain your idea or steps when answering questions or coding for the tasks.
Remember to save constantly when you are working on the lab.
