# Lab Assignment 1

In this lab assignment, students will need to complete the CSRF lab module of the SEED Labs using Ubuntu 16.04 VM. You will learn to code and attack a vulnerable social media application, which has already been installed in our VM. Coding experience is recommended, so you might want to work with someone with computer science backgrounds. 


## Environment Setup

Go to [Lab Environment Setup page](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/lab_env.html) to install the pre-built VM image (Ubuntu 16.04 32 bits).

- VM setup instruction (in Virtualbox): http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs_16.04/Documents/SEEDVM_VirtualBoxManual.pdf
- You only need one VM to do this lab, but you may still want to follow Appendix A to set up multiple VMs which will likely be used in future labs
- User manual (contains the usernames and passowrds for the VM): http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Documentation/Ubuntu16_04_VM/Ubuntu16_04_VM_Manual.pdf
