# Lab Assignment 1

In this lab assignment, you will need to complete the XSS lab module of the SEED Labs using Ubuntu 16.04 VM. You will learn to code and attack a vulnerable social media application, which has already been installed in our VM. Coding experience is recommended, so you might want to work with someone with computer science backgrounds. 


## Environment Setup

Go to [Lab Environment Setup page](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/lab_env.html) to install the pre-built VM image (Ubuntu 16.04 32 bits). You cannot work on it on your personal machine.  
- Install VirtualBox first, if you do not have it already
- VM setup instruction (read carefully): http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs_16.04/Documents/SEEDVM_VirtualBoxManual.pdf
- You only need one VM to do this lab, but you may still want to follow Appendix A to set up multiple VMs which will likely be used in future labs. For this lab, network configuration (explained in Appendix B) is also not needed, but will likely be needed for a future lab.
- User manual (contains the usernames and passowrds for the VM): http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Documentation/Ubuntu16_04_VM/Ubuntu16_04_VM_Manual.pdf

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack Lab (50 points)

Please thoroughly read through the [lab description](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_16.04/PDF/Web_XSS_Elgg_new.pdf) and complete all the tasks listed on it.
