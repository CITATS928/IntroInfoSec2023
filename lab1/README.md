# Lab Assignment 1

In this lab assignment, you will need to complete the XSS lab module in the SEED Labs using Ubuntu 16.04 VM. You will learn to code and attack a vulnerable social media application, which has already been installed in the VM. Coding experience is recommended, so you might want to work with someone with computer science backgrounds. 


## Environment Setup

Go to [Lab Environment Setup page](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/lab_env.html) to install the pre-built VM image (Ubuntu 16.04 32 bits). You cannot work on it directly on your personal machine.  
- Install VirtualBox first, if you do not have it already. (Note: VirtualBox is available for most consumer computers, but there are some exceptions for certain hardware architectures, such as Apple products with M1 Chip. If you have trouble with this step, we encourage you to find a solution by yourself, get a free copy of VMWare Fusion as an MSSI student (contact Chris pls), or use a computer in our lab.)
- VM setup instruction (read very carefully): http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs_16.04/Documents/SEEDVM_VirtualBoxManual.pdf
- You only need one VM to do this lab, but you may still want to follow Appendix A to set up multiple VMs which will likely be used in future labs. For this lab, network configuration (explained in Appendix B) is not needed, but will likely be needed for a future lab.
- User manual (contains the usernames and passowrds for the VM): http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Documentation/Ubuntu16_04_VM/Ubuntu16_04_VM_Manual.pdf

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack Lab (50 points)

Please thoroughly read through the [lab description](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_16.04/PDF/Web_XSS_Elgg_new.pdf) and complete all the tasks listed on it. We recommend you go through all the instructions before you start. You will need to write a detailed report with adequate screenshots and explanations, including your code and demonstration that your attacks are successful.

In addition, please answer the following questions:

	(1) In 3.2 task 1, why can we pop up a window using the first sample code provided in 3.2 Task 1? Please explain briefly how this happens. Is such an attack still possible in today's mainstream browsers? (To answer this question, you may need to search for any useful resources by yourself, and remember to provide the relevant evidence/references below.)

	(2) In 3.3 task 2, If your operation is correct, you will be able to see a "cookie" in the window that pops up. Please briefly explain why the code you add in this task allows you to see this "cookie".


## Submission Details

- Each group only needs to submit one report in PDF format.
- Please list group members in your report explicitly and each member's contribution.
- Only typed reports are accepted.

## Grading

- Completeness (30 pts): All the steps as instructed in the lab manual must be included in the report with adequate evidence.
- Presentation (20 pts): The report must be clear and correct in organization and writing with adequate explanation.
