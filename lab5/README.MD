# Lab Assignment 5 - Data Privacy
This lab assignment studies data privacy issues using a tool called ARX on a SEED VM. In this lab, you will learn data anonymization by applying the k-anonymity model.

## Lab Manual and Datasets

The lab manual and several datasets are available on Canvas. You will find a set of questions and tasks in the lab manual. 

## Environment Setup

Go to [Lab Environment Setup page](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/lab_env.html) to install the pre-built VM image. You should not work on this lab on your personal machine to avoid potential software compatibility and other issues.  
- Install VirtualBox first, if you do not have it already
- VM setup instruction (read carefully): https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_16.04/Documents/SEEDVM_VirtualBoxManual.pdf
- You only need one VM to do this lab. For this lab, network configuration (explained in Appendix B) is also not needed.
- User manual (contains the usernames and passowrds for the VM): https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_16.04/Documents/SEEDVM_VirtualBoxManual.pdf
