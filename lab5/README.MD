# Lab Assignment 5 - Data Privacy

In this lab assignment, you will need to complete the Data Privacy Lab in the SEED Labs using the ARX tools. In this lab, students will learn data anonymization and practice using ARX, a data anonymization tool, to apply k-anonymity.

## Lab Manual

The lab manual is available on Canvas. You will find questions and task in the lab manual. 
The dataset needed for this lab is on Canvas: adults.csv, patients_kanon.csv, Hierarchies folder. Please douwnload the zip file for all the datasets that you need for this lab.

## Environment Setup

Go to [Lab Environment Setup page](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/lab_env.html) to install the pre-built VM image. You cannot work on it on your personal machine.  
- Install VirtualBox first, if you do not have it already
- VM setup instruction (read carefully): https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_16.04/Documents/SEEDVM_VirtualBoxManual.pdf
- You only need one VM to do this lab, but you may still want to follow Appendix A to set up multiple VMs which will likely be used in future labs. For this lab, network configuration (explained in Appendix B) is also not needed, but will likely be needed for a future lab.
- User manual (contains the usernames and passowrds for the VM): https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_16.04/Documents/SEEDVM_VirtualBoxManual.pdf

Directly install ARX tool inside the SEED VM: 
1. Open the VM 
2. Go to the ARX download website: https://arx.deidentifier.org/ 
3. Download the Linus version of the ARX 
4. After download the ARX, in the file folder, open terminal 
5. Use the command chmod +x yourfilename.run to make your RUN file executable. 
6. Use the command ./yourfilename.run to execute your RUN file for downloading the ARX tools on your SEED VM.
